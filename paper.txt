== Problem
The problem with being STEM students is that we have an incredibly poor ability
to recognize artists from paintings. However, as with most problems in the
modern age, they are easily solved with computers and math. Our specific problem
is: given a painting and two possible artists, which artist made the painting?
The problem itself is interesting although not important. It approaches the
field of forgery detection, as our project is forgery detection at its most
basic level: artist classification.

We are going about this project by using a machine learning algorithm (Support
Vector Machine, SVM) to make an educated estimate on who the artist is. With
zero training, the computer would make simply a random guess. To turn this guess
into an educated estimate, we train it on data from six different features of
each painting, telling the computer to which artist the features belong to.
SVM can only make a decision based on one feature, so we run the SVM once for
each feature and then we combine the outcomes of each feature using a weighted
voting algorithm, where each feature's result gets a certain number of votes,
and the winner is then declared by the program with a "sureness" factor.
